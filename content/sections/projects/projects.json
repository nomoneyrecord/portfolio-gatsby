      "description": "This simple, but cool calculator app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it was a valuable learning experience. The app captures button clicks from the user and performs calculations based on the input, using DOM elements to represent various calculator functions. I took care to include error handling in the JavaScript code to ensure that the app can handle different user input scenarios. Overall, it was exciting to see how JavaScript can be used to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. This project allowed me to practice my coding skills while also gaining a better understanding of how to create effective user experiences.",
