Welcome! I'm a software engineer and problem-solver with a deep passion for technology, innovation, and creative thinking. My journey began with floppy disk games on an IBM computer, evolving into a lifelong obsession with building, breaking, and understanding how things workâ€”whether it was tinkering with PlayStations, composing music, or mastering survival skills.

Today, I bring that same curiosity and determination to software engineering, crafting dynamic applications that solve real-world problems. My background blends analytical precision with creative ingenuity, enabling me to approach challenges with fresh perspectives and develop impactful solutions.

This portfolio is a reflection of my growth, expertise, and commitment to pushing boundaries in software development. Let's build something remarkable together.
