Welcome to my portfolio website, where my personal and professional journey converge. From a young age, I was captivated by science, learning, technology, nature, and software engineering, fueling a lifelong passion that continues to drive me today.

It all started with playing floppy disk games on an IBM computer, delving into the intricacies of technology and navigating low-level files using the command line. This early fascination grew into a diverse range of pursuits, from practicing survival skills to dismantling PlayStations and composing music. Now, as a rapidly growing software engineer, I find immense excitement in building innovative applications that push boundaries and enhance lives.

With a well-rounded background, deep appreciation for technology, and a blend of analytical and creative thinking, I strive to create transformative solutions. My portfolio showcases my expertise, achievements, and dedication to science and software engineering. Join me on this exhilarating journey of innovation and discovery as we shape a brighter future together.
